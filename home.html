<h1 style="color: blueviolet;">Signs that it may be time to hire</h1>
     
<p>At smaller companies, employees often take on many roles, frequently switching from task to task and working
outside their job description to keep up with business growth. Even though this ability to work across departments
is a sign of flexibility, resourcefulness, and drive, it can also be a clue that your employees are stretched too thin.
This over-extension can eventually lead to burnout, low productivity, and inefficiencies in your business.

 To keep your business growing and maintain high employee morale, watch out for the following signs that itâ€™s time 
 to grow your team:</p>
 <br>
 <ul>
    <li>High employee turnover rate</li>
    <li>Unusual spikes in customer complaints</li>
    <li>Rise in overtime costs</li>
    <li>Frequently falling short of goals</li>

 </ul>
